# Custom SMD Solder Wire Pad KiCad Footprints
A few KiCad footprints I made because 1x2mm and 5x10mm were too small and too big respectively for what I wanted to use them for.

This repository contains these custom sizes:
- 1.5x3mm
- 2x4mm
- 2.5x5mm
- 3x6mm

Download the footprint files in the repository and move them into the folder:

`Program Files/KiCad/[version]/share/kicad/footprints/Connector_Wire.pretty`
